This\n# problem was solved by implementing the new way to access AICs (i.e., \n# 'AIC(model)').\n# The remaining problem is that the new 'lme4' package no longer accepts the \n# null model with the 'dummy' variable as valid; it returns the error 'Error: \n# grouping factors must have > 1 sampled level'.\n# A version of the old 'lme4' package exists as 'lme4.0'.  I was not able to get\n# 'lme4.0' to work with my code here.\n\ninstall.packages(\"lme4\", dependencies = TRUE)   # install package if not already installed\n\ndata = read.table(\"altereddata.txt\", header = TRUE)      \ndata[ , 11] = -1\ncolnames(data)[11] = \"dummy\"\ndata = split(data, data$strain)\n\n# analysis as described in Fairless et al 2012:\n# \"We first investigated litter membership by asking whether littermates were \n# more alike in their degree of sociability than non-littermates, after \n# controlling for strain, sex, and age. In other words, does the sociability of \n# mice cluster according to litter membership? . . . We analyzed social cylinder \n# investigation (which consisted predominantly of sniffing of the social cylinder) \n# in a linear mixed effects model for each strain as y = β0 + β1 (sex) + β2 \n# (age) + β1,2 (sex, age) + b1 (litter) where sex, age, and their interaction \n# were modeled as fixed effects and litter was modeled as a random effect. This \n# ‘litter’ model was compared to a ‘null’ model, which differed from the ‘litter’\n# model only by fictionally assigning all mice to the same litter.\"\n\nlibrary(lme4)\n\nfor(iter in 1:length(data)) {\n  \n     model = lmer(soc.3rd5min~age*sex*(1|litter), data = data[[iter]])     # litter model with experimental data\n     litteraic = AIC(model)                       \n     model = lmer(soc.3rd5min~age*sex*(1|dummy), data = data[[iter]])      # null model with dummy random effects variable\n     nullaic = AIC(model)                         \n     aicdiff = nullaic - litteraic                                         # assumes litteraic < nullaic\n     a = exp(-0.5 * aicdiff)\n     # probability that litter model is the preferred model to the null model\n     probprefermodel = 1 - (a / (1 + a))\n     # how many times more likely the litter model is preferred to the null model\n     timesprefermodel = probprefermodel / (a / (1 + a))     \n\n     strainname = gsub(\"[[:punct:]]\", \"\", names(data)[iter])     # removes \"/\" from strain name\n     sink(file = paste(\"aicmodelcomparison,\", strainname, \".txt\", sep = \"\"))\n     \n     print(paste(\"These results are for the\", names(data)[iter], \"mice\"))\n     print(paste(\"The AIC for the litter model is\", litteraic))\n     print(paste(\"The AIC for the null model is\", nullaic))\n     print(paste(\"The difference between the AICs of the two models is\", aicdiff))\n     print(paste(\"The probability that the litter model is the preferred model is \", \n                 probprefermodel, \"%\", sep = \"\"))\n     print(paste(\"The litter model is\", timesprefermodel, \n                 \"times more likely to be preferred than the null model\"))\n\n     sink(file = NULL)\n}\n",
